## Notes for Developers

- All images should be optimized for web to ensure fast page loading
- The page uses framer-motion for animations, which are triggered on scroll
- Make sure all images are properly credited if they are not owned by DEAN Initiative
- Consider adding alt text that accurately describes each image for accessibility
- The image preloading in the useEffect hook ensures images are loaded before they're needed, reducing layout shifts
