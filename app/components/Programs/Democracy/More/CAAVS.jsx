              In preparation for the 2023 Presidential election, DEAN Initiative identified a prevalent challenge in the
              Kilankwa and Kwali Central areas of Kwali LGA, as well as Abaji Central in Abaji LGA. The issue at
              hand was the need for community-wide enlightenment on election day processes and the imperative to
              discourage vote buying and selling.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--dean-blue)] mt-10 mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Recognizing the importance of inclusive representation, DEAN Initiative organized community town hall meetings, 
              bringing together stakeholders such as religious leaders, security personnel, INEC officials, CSO representatives, 
              women groups, PWDs, youth groups, and other community representatives.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--dean-blue)] mt-10 mb-4">Our Approach</h3>
            <p>
              To address this challenge, DEAN Initiative meticulously planned and executed community town hall meetings, 
              strategically designed to enlighten citizens on the intricacies of election day processes and actively 
              discourage the practice of vote buying and selling. The emphasis on inclusive representation ensured a 
              comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and fostered a collaborative approach to finding solutions. 
              The town hall meetings were attended by a total of over 180 participants, creating a robust platform for 
              engagement and dialogue among diverse community members.
